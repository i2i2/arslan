            <dd>Located on Beijing's Wudaoying Hutong, this is a real local favourite. Stuff'd makes their own sausages, and serves a wide range of other great Western food from pizza's to salads.

            <dt><strong><u>Temple Restaurant</u></strong><br> Rating: <font color="gold">★★★★☆</font></dt><br>
            <dd>Repeatedly voted as one of the best Western restaurants in Beijing, eating out at Temple Restaurant is a great experience. The restaurant has award winning chefs and is set in an exquisite setting - an ancient Tibetan temple that was only recently discovered. The restaurant (and connecting hotel) have won preservation awards, and the temple itself is also recognized by UNESCO. <p><a href="more\temple rest.html">more</a></p>

            <dt><strong><u>Capital M</u></strong> <br> Rating:<font color="gold">★★★★☆</font></dt><br>
            <dd>This hotel, positioned so that it has a balcony overlooking Qianmen, the front gate of Tian'anmen Square, is well known for its good food, afternoon tea, and desserts. Best in spring and autumn when the sky is clear and sitting outside is a treat. <p><a href="more\capital m.html">more</a></p>

            <dt><strong><u>Bottega</u></strong> <br> Rating: <font color="gold">★★★★☆</font></dt><br>
            <dd><b>Italian</b><br>Set up by two Italian brothers, this Italian family-style restaurant dishes out some great pizzas, pastas, as well as meat and fish dishes. We highly recommend their lunch menu, which includes two courses for less than 100 yuan. Bottega is also family friendly. <p><a href="more\bottega.html">more</a></p>
