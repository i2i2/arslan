            <dt><strong><u>The Local</u></strong><br> Rating: <font color="gold">★★★★★</font></dt><br>
            <dd>Sportsbar/pub the Local has a lot to offer for those who want to watch sports games, which due to time difference, are usually on at very bizarre times in Beijing. It is one of the places with the best range of draught beers, and one of the few that offers cider. Their Western Food selection is also good, and there are a few tables outside which is nice on good days. If you do go for the sports, call up ahead to see if they are showing your game. Happy hour is daily between 4pm and 8pm. <p><a href="more\the local.html">more</a></p>

            <dt><strong><u>Vics</u></strong><br> Rating: <font color="gold">★★★★★</font></dt><br>
            <dd>Want to pretend you are 18 years old again? Vics is one of Beijing's biggest clubs, with DJs playing a mix of R&B, soul, reggae, and hip hop all night long. You'll find a mix of foreign and Chinese patrons, and every Wednesday is ladies night with free drinks for ladies.<br> Sometimes famous foreign DJs pass through the doors too, so you never know if you could be reliving (or continuing) your party years in this pumping, lit-up club. <p><a href="more\vics.html">more</a></p>

            <dt><strong><u>Atmosphere Bar</u></strong><br> Rating: <font color="gold">★★★★☆</font></dt><br>
            <dd>Atmosphere is the highest bar in Beijing, located on the 80th floor of the Shangri-la-owned China World Summit Wing Hotel in Beijing's Central Business District. The cocktails are great, and the view is even better. Just make sure that you're going on a blue-sky day, or else the view will be wasted. Perfect if you're looking to impress somebody. <p><a href="more\atmosphere bar.html">more</a></p>

            <dt><strong><u>Mokihi</u></strong><br>Rating: <font color="gold">★★★★☆</font></dt><br>
            <dd>A Japanese-style whisky and cocktail bar, Mokihi has a huge menu with everything you can think of. The alcohol is of good quality, which means it is real, unlike many Beijing bars, and the service is very good. They also serve a variety of snacks, and the bar is open a lot later than most other venues.<br>The cocktails can be quite expensive, but prices generally stay between 60 to 80 yuan for cocktails. The bartenders can also make your own creation for you if you ask and tell them your preferences.  <p><a href="more\mokihi.html">more</a></p>
